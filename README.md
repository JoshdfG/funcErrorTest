# error Project Test

This Solidity smart contract, named `errorProjectTest`, provides a set of functions that demonstrate the usage of global assertions in Ethereum smart contracts. These global assertions, namely `assert`, `require`, and `revert`, are crucial for enforcing certain conditions within the contract, ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain application.

## Motivation

In Ethereum smart contract development, it is essential to handle conditions and constraints effectively to prevent unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities. The `errorProjectTest` contract serves as a simple yet illustrative example of how to use global assertions in different scenarios, specifically showcasing the `assert`, `require`, and `revert` functions.

## Functions Overview

### `assertErrorFunctionn(uint _value)`

This function tests the `assert` global function by verifying that the provided input value is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, the assertion will trigger an exception.

### `requireErrorFunction(uint _value)`

The `require` global function is demonstrated in this function, validating that the input value is greater than 10. If the condition is not satisfied, a custom error message is returned along with the requirement failure.

### `revertErrorFunction(uint _value)`

Here, the `revert` global function is utilized to check if the input value is less than 10. If the condition is not met, the function reverts the transaction with a specific error message.

## Usage

1. Deploy the `errorProjectTest` contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

2. Interact with the contract by calling the desired function:

   - `# error Project Test
